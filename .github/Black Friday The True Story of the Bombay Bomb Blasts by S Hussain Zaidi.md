He also chronicles the massive investigation that ensued, which led to the arrest and conviction of more than 100 accused.
 
Black Friday is a gripping and shocking account of one of the worst terrorist attacks in Indian history, and the complex web of crime, politics, and violence that surrounds it. It is also a tribute to the courage and resilience of the people of Bombay, who rose above the tragedy and rebuilt their lives.
